Getting your business on Google Maps is handled through a service called Google Business Profile (it used to be called Google My Business). 
Here's a step-by-step guide on how you would do that:

Create a Google Account: If you don't already have one, you'll need a standard Google account to manage your business profile.
Go to Google Business Profile: Navigate to the official website at https://www.google.com/business/ and click "Manage Now."

Search for Your Business: Google will prompt you to search for your business by name and address.
If it's already listed, you can claim the profile.
If it's not listed, you will be guided to create a new profile from scratch.

Enter Your Business Details: You'll be asked to provide key information, including:
Your full business name and category (e.g., "Web Development," "Coffee Shop").
The physical address where your business is located.
Your service areas (if you serve customers at their location).
Your business phone number and website URL.
Your business hours.

Verification: This is a crucial step where Google confirms that your business is real and that you are the owner. The most common method is a postcard with a verification code that they mail to your physical business address. Other methods, like a phone call or email, may also be available. Once you receive the code, you'll enter it online to finalize the process.

Complete Your Profile: After you're verified, you can fill out the rest of your profile. This is where you can add photos of your business, write a description, post updates, and respond to customer reviews. The more complete your profile, the better it will perform in search results.

Once your profile is verified and complete, your business will start appearing on Google Maps and in Google Search results when people look for your business or businesses like yours in your area.
