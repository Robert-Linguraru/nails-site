1. Image Optimization & Performance:
* Problem: A long list of high-resolution JPGs can significantly slow down your page load, especially on mobile, leading to a poor user experience.
* Suggestion:
* Compress Images: Use tools (online or software like TinyPNG, ImageOptim) to reduce file sizes without noticeable loss in quality.
* Modern Formats: Consider converting images to modern formats like WebP. They offer superior compression compared to JPG/PNG. You can use <picture> tags for fallback to JPG for older browsers.
* Lazy Loading: Implement loading="lazy" on your <img> tags. This tells the browser to only load images when they are about to enter the viewport, saving bandwidth and initial load time.

Video Showcase: A short, high-quality video montage of your work or a time-lapse of a nail art creation could be incredibly engaging.
